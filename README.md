# What Is This?
This is a collection of patches for the TrotMania series to fix issues while using the themes on Project Outfox AlphaV (Primarily lag issues on the Music Select screen.)

# Known Issues:
* TM Euphorius does not display Mode Wheel items (I don't know, I spent an hour trying to figure out why. The lua script is being loaded, it just. Doesn't appear.)
